#+Author: Benjamin Turner

* Why Vim when there are so many good alternatives?
* Vi-style bindings in other places
    - Editors
    - Shells
* Modal editing: Two Main Modes
    - Normal
      - Navigating and understanding text
    - Insert
      - Insert Text
* Vim Language
* Search
    - Big improvements with =incsearch= and =hls=
    - =:substitute= -- =:%s/regex/replace/g=
* Macros
    - Registers?
    - Recording / Running
    - Think of them as being much more lightweight than other "macros", though they can become quite large if you want
      - "Put a semicolon at the end of each line"
      - think of other examples
* Most of the previous stuff can be done in other editors with their "vi-mode" plugins
* =ex= Mode
    - You've already made use of this with =:w= and =:q=. Maybe even if you've tried the =:help= command
    - =:h ex-cmd-index= -- get a list of all ex commands
    - =:vimgrep=
      - Quickfix 
      - Add mappings for quicker navigation
    - =:global=
      - History of =grep= -- Came from =ed= and can still be accessed from within Vim by typing =Q=
	- "Global regular expression print"
      - =:g/regex/normal @q=
* Scripting Vim
    - =vim -c ":<do-stuff>"=
* Is it "worth it" to learn Vim?
* Resources
